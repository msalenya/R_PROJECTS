This project involves using R for analyzing a credit card fraud dataset to identify fraudulent transactions. The process includes data manipulation, visualization, and preparing the dataset for machine learning model building. The main steps in the analysis are as follows:
1. Data Import and Cleaning
The dataset, consisting of credit card transactions, is imported and merged from two sources: fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv. After combining the data, the following steps are performed:
* Handling Missing Values: Missing values are identified and either removed or imputed based on the context of the variables.
* Removing Duplicates: Duplicate entries are checked and removed to ensure data integrity.
* Date and Time Manipulation: The transaction date and time are separated into different columns for more detailed analysis. Additionally, customer age is calculated based on the date of birth (dob).
2. Data Transformation
The categorical variables, such as merchant, category, gender, and location attributes (e.g., city, state), are converted to factors. This is essential for downstream modeling, as factorization allows machine learning algorithms to interpret categorical data correctly.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase uses data visualization techniques to explore the key patterns in the dataset:
* Fraud by Gender: A bar chart is plotted using ggplot2 to reveal which gender is more likely to commit fraud. The visualization shows the distribution of fraudulent transactions across genders.
* Fraud by Merchant: The dataset is examined to identify which merchants have the highest rates of fraudulent activity. This can help businesses understand which sectors or vendors may be more prone to fraud.
Additional analyses focus on other key fraud-related metrics, such as fraud by transaction amount, geographic location, and time of the day, which are useful for identifying common characteristics of fraudulent transactions.
4. Feature Engineering
To improve the predictive power of the model, several new features are engineered:
* Transaction Time: Splitting the transaction date and time into separate variables enables a more granular analysis of fraud trends based on time.
* Customer Age: Customer age is derived from the date of birth, which helps in understanding whether age plays a role in the likelihood of committing or falling victim to fraud.
5. Data Visualization
Several visualizations are generated to highlight patterns and anomalies in the data:
* Most Defrauded Gender: A bar chart is generated to visualize the most common gender involved in fraudulent transactions.
* Top Fraudulent Merchants: Visualizations are created to highlight which merchants report the highest number of fraudulent transactions, which can help target specific areas for further investigation.
6. Predictive Modeling (Not Yet Visible)
Although the code preview does not include the modeling part, it typically would involve:
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Applying machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, or logistic regression to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.
* Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the model accurately predicts fraudulent activity.
Conclusion
The analysis in R effectively cleans, visualizes, and prepares the dataset for building predictive models to detect fraudulent transactions. The insights gained from the EDA can help businesses mitigate fraud risks, while the eventual machine learning models can provide an automated solution to identify suspicious transactions in real-time.
